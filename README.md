Background Information



The call centre manager is looking for transparency and insight into the data they have at the call centre. For example: total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. What he is after is an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. A dashboard on Call Centre trends that he can use as a basis for discussion with management? 



The task is to Create a dashboard in Power BI for him that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.  

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
